Dear All, below is the final presentation format for the upcoming Wednesday class. Each group should please try to wrap up in 10 minutes.

1) Introduce yourself and your and other people's role on the project

2) Describe your project at a high level. We should all know what each other is doing at this point, but it

helps to “set the stage” for you presentation.

3) Did you hit your project time goals? (Include Gantt Chart along with other details as you see necessary)

4) What has changed since the mid checkpoint? (Make sure to include Burn Up or Burn Down Chart)

5) What were the challenges in SE as a process?
