# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a working weather app or website. The website will be accessible and will display weather information. It will include a dynamic user interface and pull real information directly from the internet. It will be capable of displaying information relevant and desired by the end user in a way that is meant to be visually appealing.

Key features:
 - Memory quiz game for recent weather
 - Accessibility (i.e. high contrast, audio option, multiple languages)
   + Settings screen (text size, languagesm other accesibility options)
   + 'Other' settings screen (location, celsius vs farenheit, other units such as mph winds etc)
 - Customizability (i.e. information display in forecast, color themes, number of days in forecast)
 - May build radar display to show rainfall or other information


# Anticipated Technologies
The project will be all of mostly coded in Python, using any IDE appropriate. All updates and changes to the code will be pushed and pulled from the team GitHub.
Weather API -- available online for free
We will also implement the use of Google Collab in order to make updates more efficient and easy for us.
We may or may not decide to 'upgrade' to an app, or possibly a physical display if time permits. This is not planned but may be included in later development.

# Method/Approach
We plan to 'attack' this project through the use of the 'waterfall' design method. We will follow the group assignments in the class as well as take initiative to meet and produce a plan for, and eventually a product, that is what we have outlined above. Testing will be ongoing and any code updates will be pushed to the team GitHub with adequate commenting and notes. Group meetings will occur regularly, tentatively on Mondays at 2 pm.


# Estimated Timeline
This project will be completed within the six week timeline allowed in the class. We will make regular progress and have regular meetings, testing the project as we develop. 
Major milestones will be:
 - Design document (16, May)
 - Code 'kickoff' (19, May)
 - First progress review and testing (26, May and 2, June)
 - Finish project (Finals week)
(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems
If we opt to build a radar screen, we may find issues with its compatibility with the application we choose. 
The only other issue that may occur would be with the timeline. We will need to be diligent and proactive in order to be successful in this project.


Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
