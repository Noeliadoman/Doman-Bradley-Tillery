Team name:Weather Dashboard Team 

Team members: Nathaniel Tillery, Noelia Doman, and Aliece Bradley

# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a working weather app or website. The website will be accessible and will display weather information. It will include a dynamic user interface and pull real information directly from the internet. It will be capable of displaying information relevant and desired by the end user in a way that is meant to be visually appealing to the creators.

Key features:
 - Memory quiz game for recent weather (This will be done by clicking a game button, and having the program pull weather data from the API, then ask a question. i.e. "Welcome to Weather Game! Did it rain yesterday in [your location]?" It may or may not keep score, but that will be the basic premise of the game.
 - Accessibility (i.e. high contrast, audio option)
   + Settings screen (text size and other accesibility options)
   + 'Other' settings screen (location, celsius vs farenheit, other units such as mph winds etc)
 - Customizability (i.e. information display in forecast, color themes, number of days in forecast)
 - May build radar display to show rainfall or other information


# Anticipated Technologies
The project will be all of mostly coded in Python, using any IDE appropriate. All updates and changes to the code will be pushed and pulled from the team GitHub.
Weather API -- available online for free
We will also implement the use of Google Collab in order to make updates more efficient and easy for us.


# Method/Approach
We plan to 'attack' this project through the use of a mix of the 'waterfall' design method and the 'Agile' design method. We will follow the group assignments in the class as well as take initiative to meet and produce a plan for, and eventually a product, that is what we have outlined above. Testing will be ongoing and any code updates will be pushed to the team GitHub with adequate commenting and notes. Group meetings will occur regularly, tentatively on Mondays at 2 pm.
The methods will be blended together arbitarily in the way that is most convenient. A Gantt chart will be used as the main planning, and then we will move into development and testing of code, with meetings every Monday and as needed to ensure progress is swift and effective.

# Estimated Timeline
This project will be completed within the six week timeline allowed in the class. We will make regular progress and have regular meetings, testing the project as we develop. 
Major milestones will be:
 -  Design document (16, May)
 -  Code 'kickoff' (19, May)
 -  Final proposal draft, software requierents, progress check (24, May)
 -  Additional progress check-in (27, May)
 -  Progress check-in #3 (2, June)
 -  Finish project (Finals week)
(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems
Our issues will be in managing our time and getting a MVP by the end of the semester, as this is a very short semester. We will overcome this by creating a Gantt chart and having regular meetings.
We will likely not be able to add the radar in time. We will add this last if we have time, but will refrain from spending time on it in the beginning as it is not listed as a major requirement.

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
